# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,
and this is my website to post things related to data and tech (and may be some Real Estate).

I hold a B.E. in Industrial Engineering and MBA in Operations Management from Thapar University (2007-2012).

Since 2012 I primarily worked in the field of Project/Portfolio Management internationally and had multiple roles in different geographies.

During this tenure I figured out my true calling and moved into Data Science and Analytics. I continually make efforts to grow and develop projects using data professionally and for my personal use. 

During my free time, I would be doing photography, Real Estate investing and biking.

Nowadays I am working at Scarsin Corporation (Toronto Region) as a Data Analyst.
